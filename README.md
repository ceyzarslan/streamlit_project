This repository contains my very first Streamlit project, an interactive web application that introduces me, my professional background, and current pursuits in technology. The app is built using Streamlit, a powerful Python library for creating web apps quickly and efficiently.

Key Features:
Personal Introduction: Displays my name, profession, and contact information, all designed with a clean and minimalist approach.
Erasmus+ and IT Background: Highlights my goal to leverage IT internships and Erasmus+ experiences to develop impactful tech solutions, with a focus on AWS security systems and image processing techniques.

Column Layout: Implements a 3-column design with unique content:
Column 1: A brief introduction to Lorem Ipsum, for layout demonstration.
Column 2: An image randomly generated from the internet.
Column 3: A simple list with dynamic bullet points.

How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Install the necessary dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the app locally using streamlit run app.py.
This project serves as a starting point for my journey in developing data-driven interactive web applications.
